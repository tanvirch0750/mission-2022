              Being honest with yourself about your current condition and the

              Making New Year’s resolutions is inherently hopeful and
              optimistic. You expect things can get better for you, for your
              work experience or for your community. This positive view of the
              future, in turn, tends to motivate action.

              Most New Year’s resolutions have some impact on others. Even if
              they are about individual self-improvement, they affect families,
              friends, colleagues and communities. Your resolution to get
              healthy will keep you around longer for your family and friends.

              Changing ingrained habits is no easy task, so before diving
              head-first into your New Year goals, it is important to take a
              step back and get ready for that impending change. The first
              breakthrough in change is taking a personal inventory. Being that
              it’s the end of one year and the beginning of the next, it’s
              perfect timing to take stock in the past year’s accomplishments.

              You would be surprised how often people set goals that are not for
              themselves. These goals could be dictated or coerced by a manager,
              spouse, or parental / peer pressure.While it’s nice to have some
              external support, if you don’t share the same passion, the
              resolution has a small chance of succeeding and could even be dead
              on arrival.

              Break up big goals into smaller goals
            </h3>
            <p class="goal-box-description">
              A lot of us tend to be over eager and grandiose when it comes to
              resolutions. We have the best of intentions and may accidentally
              take on a goal that is too big to achieve. Thus, it’s helpful to
              divide a big goal into smaller goals that are more achievable.
              Let’s say you are the leader of an alien race, and your resolution
              for 2021 is capturing the planet Earth. That is a huge goal!! You
              can’t just tell your intergalactic fleet of spaceships “take over
              planet Earth” and expect success.
