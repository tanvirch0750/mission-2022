              Being honest with yourself about your current condition and the
              distance to your preferred situation is key to improvement. And
              being intentional about how you want to grow and develop will help
              you achieve results.

            <h4 class="resolution-box-title">Hope and Engagement</h4>
            <p class="resolution-box-description">
              Making New Year’s resolutions is inherently hopeful and
              optimistic. You expect things can get better for you, for your
              work experience or for your community. This positive view of the
              future, in turn, tends to motivate action.

            />

            <h4 class="resolution-box-title">Responsibility</h4>
            <p class="resolution-box-description">
              Most New Year’s resolutions have some impact on others. Even if
              they are about individual self-improvement, they affect families,
              friends, colleagues and communities. Your resolution to get
              healthy will keep you around longer for your family and friends.
